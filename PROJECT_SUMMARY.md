# AI Interview Screener - Project Summary

## Overall Architecture

The AI Interview Screener is a Django-based backend system that automates the entire interview process using AI and voice technology. The architecture follows a clean, scalable design with clear separation of concerns.

### High-Level Architecture Components:

1. **Django REST API Layer** - Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer** - External integrations (OpenAI, Twilio, Resume parsing)
3. **Data Layer** - Django ORM with PostgreSQL-ready models
4. **Webhook Layer** - Handles Twilio callbacks and status updates
5. **Authentication Layer** - API key-based security

### System Flow:
```
Job Description → AI Question Generation → Candidate Creation → 
Voice Interview → Response Recording → AI Analysis → Results & Recommendations
```

## Data Design Summary

### Core Models:

1. **Candidate** - Stores candidate information and parsed resume
   - UUID primary key for security
   - E.164 phone number format
   - Resume file storage with text extraction
   - Timestamps for audit trail

2. **JobDescription** - Job details and AI-generated questions
   - Title and description fields
   - JSON field for storing generated questions
   - One-to-many relationship with interviews

3. **Interview** - Main interview session tracking
   - Links candidate to job description
   - Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
   - Twilio call and recording metadata
   - Duration and completion timestamps

4. **InterviewResponse** - Individual question responses
   - Question text and number
   - Audio URL and transcript
   - AI-generated score and feedback
   - Ordered by question number

5. **InterviewResult** - Final analysis and recommendations
   - Overall score (0-10)
   - Hire/consider/reject recommendation
   - Strengths and areas for improvement lists
   - One-to-one relationship with interview

### Key Design Decisions:
- **UUID Primary Keys** - Enhanced security and scalability
- **JSON Fields** - Flexible storage for AI-generated content
- **File Upload Handling** - Secure resume storage with parsing
- **Audit Trail** - Comprehensive timestamp tracking
- **Status Management** - Clear interview state tracking

## AI Usage Points

### 1. Question Generation (OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo)
**Location**: `OpenAIService.generate_questions_from_jd()`
**Purpose**: Convert job descriptions to relevant interview questions
**Input**: Job title and description
**Output**: 5-7 structured questions
**Context**: Technical skills, problem-solving, communication, cultural fit

**Prompt Structure**:
```
Based on the job description, generate 5-7 relevant interview questions.
Focus on: technical skills, problem-solving, communication, cultural fit, achievements.
Return as JSON array of strings.
```

### 2. Response Analysis (OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo)
**Location**: `OpenAIService.analyze_response()`
**Purpose**: Score individual question responses
**Input**: Question, response text, resume context
**Output**: Score (0-10) and detailed feedback
**Evaluation Criteria**: Relevance, clarity, specificity, professionalism

**Prompt Structure**:
```
Analyze this interview response and provide a score (0-10) and feedback.
Evaluate: relevance, clarity, specificity, professionalism.
Return as JSON: {"score": float, "feedback": "string"}
```

### 3. Final Recommendation (OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo)
**Location**: `OpenAIService.generate_final_recommendation()`
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive interview evaluation
**Input**: All responses, scores, resume context
**Output**: Overall score, recommendation, strengths, improvements

**Prompt Structure**:
```
Based on these interview responses, provide comprehensive evaluation:
1. Overall score (0-10)
2. Recommendation (hire/consider/reject with reasoning)
3. Key strengths (list)
4. Areas for improvement (list)
Return as structured JSON.
```

### AI Integration Features:
- **Error Handling** - Fallback responses for API failures
- **Context Awareness** - Resume text provides scoring context
- **Structured Output** - JSON responses for consistent parsing
- **Temperature Control** - Different settings for generation vs analysis

## System Flow

### 1. Job Description Processing
```
User submits JD → OpenAI generates questions → Store in database → Return question list
```

### 2. Candidate Management
```
Upload resume → Parse PDF/DOCX → Extract text → Store candidate → Ready for interview
```

### 3. Interview Execution
```
Trigger interview → Create interview record → Twilio initiates call → 
Ask questions via TTS → Record responses → Store audio URLs → Update status
```

### 4. Response Analysis
```
Webhook receives recording → Create response record → 
AI analyzes response → Store score and feedback → Update interview status
```

### 5. Results Generation
```
Interview completed → Analyze all responses → Generate final recommendation → 
Store comprehensive results → Available for retrieval
```
